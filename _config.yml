  I am a principal software engineer with 10 years' experience within a large IT organization. I have quickly progressed from internship through the grades to tech leading high traffic applications.

  I have experience across a variety of projects and exposure to a range of tools and techniques. One of my strengths is my ability to quickly learn and implement effectivelty with unfamiliar technologies.

  In the last few years I have worked on designing and implementing cloud native services and event driven solutions. Most recently I have been tech leading a junior team through challenging work build a new home quoting application as well as designing and innovating on product agnostic services to enable teams to quickly spin up and roll out future rating programs.

  I particularly enjoy experimentation; innovating and testing proof of concepts on cloud native and serverless architectures, as well working closely with other developers to design complex systems and concepts.

  My projects have given me opportunities to take ownership of the performance, stability and security of my applications and I have developed a strong focus on these aspects in my deliverables.
